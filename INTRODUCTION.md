# Intro!

Hi! Thanks for evaluating my cobbled together solution. 

Please run `npm i --force` and then  `npm start`

Overall, it's a fun exercise. I've opted to use a few packages - the main one being router - for navigating between the components/pages and the bulk for CSS and styling. 

Things I've skipped over - Error handling and testing - would have been nice but since it's not mentioned, opted to go with a happy path solution

Thanks again!
